# Oggy's Curse

My entry for the [js13kGames 2025](https://js13kgames.com/2025/).

The theme : **Black Cat**

## Plot

You are Oggy, a black cat caught in the middle of your witch master's duels.

As she unleashes powerful magic against hordes of enemies, you must survive through the chaos of fireballs, lightning, and curses raining from both sides. Your goal isn’t to fight - it’s to hunt.

Dodge, dash, and sneak between spells in this arcade-style bullet hell, where you are not playing as the hero but as the unfortunate feline just trying to survive on the side.

## Gameplay

**Arrow keys :** Move

**R :** Restart the game

**Goal :** Catch the most mice without getting hit

---

Each mouse eaten gives you 1 point.

Each bullet / spell taken makes you lose 1 HP.

Every 5 mice eaten you gain back 1 HP.

## Usage

`npm run dev` to launch a local web server (using `http-server`)

`npm run build` to build the zip

## Dependencies

* [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) to launch a web server and test the game without having to rebuild everytime
* [LittleJS](https://github.com/KilledByAPixel/LittleJS/tree/js13k) is the game engine, and the build script was taken from the example js13k starter project. It is compiled in the html file generated by the build script, and not loaded externally, as per the rules of the jam.

## TODO

Remove useless functions from LittleJS (such as drawEngineSplashScreen), or add tree-shaking
